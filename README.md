#### Sublime UI theme

> **Warning**: The UI theme, although usable, is still a work in progress and therefore incomplete at the moment.

The UI theme (from Atom's [One Light UI](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui) is contained in the `One Light.sublime-theme` file. Be sure you have a copy of the `One/` directory as well, since this contains the image resources used in the theme.

#### Syntax theme

`One Light.tmTheme` contains a port of Atom's [One Light syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-light-syntax) theme, to match the UI. It features the full TextMate set from Atom's syntax CSS, which means it has extensive support for language features.

#### JavaScript A syntax

Unsatisfied with Sublime's built-in JavaScript syntax definition, I also created an improved version, `JavaScript A`, based on Atom's [JavaScript language pack](https://github.com/atom/language-javascript). A screenshot comparing the native JavaScript syntax and `JavaScript A` can be found [here](Screenshots/JS Comparison.png).
